    I built a **Movie Recommender System** using Python and data science techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences.  
    The system leverages **content-based filtering** and fetches movie data from the **TMDb API**.  
    It is deployed using **Streamlit** to make it accessible as a web application.

    ---
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Used
    - **Programming Language**: Python  
    - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
    - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for similarity calculations)  
    - **Data Source**: TMDb API (for movie details)  
    - **Deployment**: Streamlit

    ---
    ### ‚ú® Features

    **1. üé• Movie Search & Selection**
    - Users can search for a movie by entering its name.
    - The system fetches movie details like posters, descriptions, and genres from TMDb.

    **2. ü§ñ Personalized Movie Recommendations**
    - Uses content-based filtering to suggest similar movies.
    - Calculates movie similarity using **cosine similarity** on feature vectors (genre, cast, keywords).

    **3. üñºÔ∏è Movie Details & Posters**
    - Displays recommended movies along with their posters, descriptions, and ratings.

    ---
    ### üîç How It Works

    1. The system preprocesses movie metadata (genre, keywords, cast, and crew).  
    2. Converts text-based features into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer**.  
    3. Computes **cosine similarity** between movies to find the most similar ones.  
    4. When a user selects a movie, the system retrieves the **top 5 most similar movies**.

    ---
    ### üöÄ Deployment
    - Deployed using **Streamlit**, accessible as a web application.
    - API integration ensures real-time movie data retrieval.
    - Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.

    ---
    ### üìà Future Enhancements
    - Implement collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations.
    - Integrate user ratings and reviews for better accuracy.
    - Add real-time movie trends from TMDb.
    - Enhance UI for a more cinematic experience.
